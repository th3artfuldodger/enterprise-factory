"""Autonomous patch authoring — the Factory's half of the self-healing loop.

SKOPOS's conductor posts a signed MOMUS remediation ticket here and gets back a **unified diff**.
It never gets an image, and this module never touches the deployed tree: the diff goes onto a
``momus/fix-*`` branch, a node agent builds THAT commit, MOMUS gates the resulting image, and only
then does anything ship. This file's whole job is to produce a reviewable artifact.

Five refusals shape it, and each one is a bug this codebase has already produced once:

1. **Never through ``BaseAgent``.** ``agents/base_agent.py`` catches every exception from the router
   and falls back to hard-coded JSON. A *cost-guard refusal* would therefore come back as a
   plausible-looking patch, which would then be committed and reviewed as if a model had written it.
   So this calls ``llm_router.generate`` directly and lets budget errors propagate.
2. **Never ``stream()``.** The streaming path skips both the per-product budget check and the
   output-token clamp.
3. **A non-empty ``product_id``, always.** ``assert_product_within_budget`` returns silently for an
   empty id, and the router only books spend when one is set — so without it the cap is inert.
4. **Scope is LOCAL.** Which files may be rewritten comes from this host's own map, keyed by
   component. The ticket names a component, never a path; a model that answers with a file outside
   the map is refused rather than trusted.
5. **The model never writes the diff.** It returns full file contents; the diff is computed here with
   git, in a scratch tree. Hand-written unified diffs from an LLM are unreliable in exactly the way
   that matters — a subtly malformed hunk that applies to the wrong lines.

The deployed tree is never opened for writing. ``/app`` is not even a git repository (``.dockerignore``
excludes ``.git``), which is why the diff is produced from a scratch snapshot rather than ``git diff``.

# has always been total: `.env`, `data/secrets/*.key`, satellite provider keys, all of it.
# Nothing decided what a model was allowed to see — the write side had `DENIED_PATH_PREFIXES`
# and a scope map, and the read side had a regular expression.
#
# That asymmetry is the whole bug. A patch is reviewed by a gate; a disclosure is reviewed
# by nobody, and once a secret is in a prompt it has left the building.

#: Never read, never quote, never put in a prompt. Matched on the path, before any open().
#: Split by HOW each is matched, because guessing the kind from the string is how `.env`
#: was refused while `.env.production` sailed through: a leading-dot strip had already
#: eaten the dot the rule was looking for.

THE CHECK YOUR PATCH MUST PASS
  This exact probe is re-run against your patched build before anything ships, and it alone
  decides whether the fix counts. What it reports below is the ACCEPTANCE CRITERION.
  It is a requirement, not background reading — satisfy it literally.
{_evidence_lines(ticket)}
RULES
- Fix the ROOT CAUSE. A change that only makes the probe pass (special-casing its inputs, a flag, a
  hard-coded exception) is a worse outcome than no patch at all: it will be gated as fixed and the
  bug will still be there.
- Change as little as possible. Do not reformat, do not rename.
- Do not add a dependency the component's build does not already declare — that check reads the
  Dockerfile / requirements / pyproject, so a library ALREADY listed there is available to you and
  importing it is not "adding a dependency". If the check above names a module to import, import it:
  a rule against new dependencies is not a rule against using the ones the service already has.
- Keep the module's existing style and comment density.
- You may only modify the files listed below. There is no way to create or delete files.

OUTPUT
Return a single JSON object and nothing else:
{{"summary": "<one line, imperative, <=72 chars>",
  "files": {{"<path>": "<the COMPLETE new contents of that file>"}}}}
Include a file only if you actually changed it. Do not return a diff.
