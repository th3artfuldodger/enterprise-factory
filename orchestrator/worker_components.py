        A task found ``running`` by a worker that has just started has no runner — the
        process that owned it is gone. Until now nothing said so: the first cycle simply
        dispatched it again, and because the crash happened before any failure handling,
        **the attempt was never counted**. A task that reliably kills the worker (OOM, a
        segfaulting native dep, a hang the supervisor times out) therefore restarted
        forever, with no backoff and no ladder — the one failure mode where "just retry"
        never converges.

        An unclean start IS an attempt, so it goes on ``retry_count`` and the existing
        retry ladder does the rest: backoff while attempts remain, terminalize when they
        run out. Nothing new to tune.

        Two caveats, stated where they matter.

        ONE WORKER per workspace, which is what the compose files deploy. Task rows carry no
        lease, so a second concurrent worker would already have re-dispatched these same rows
        before this method existed; adopting them does not make that worse, but it is not a
        fix for it either. Giving tasks a real owner is a separate decision.

        EVERY in-flight task is charged, not just the one that killed the worker — there is
        no way to know which one did. With a concurrency of 16 a single poison task therefore
        spends a bystander's ladder too, and after enough crashes parks its product for a
        human. That is deliberate: the alternative is the bug this method exists to fix, a
        ladder that silently resets on every restart. A worker crashing eight times over is
        not a state to keep running through quietly, and the products it was holding are
        exactly the list a human should be handed.
