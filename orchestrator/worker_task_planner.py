"""What task a product needs next — the pipeline's single answer to that question.

Lifted out of ``pipeline_worker.py`` unchanged. It sat there as four private methods on a
1180-line worker, which made the most rule-dense part of the pipeline reachable only through a
running worker with state, a queue and an event loop. Nothing here needs any of that: given a
product dict, the answer is a pure function of the flow table plus a handful of gates.

The gates are the reason this is worth naming. Three of them look like ordinary branches and are
each a bug that reached production:

* a repair-loop park is NOT the post-devops sales gate. A product parked at
  ``HUMAN_REVIEW_PENDING`` after exhausting QA repairs already carried an approval from an
  earlier pass, so idle-healing read it as "approved → sales" and bounced it straight back into
  QA. It stays parked until an operator grants another repair cycle.
* the landing fast path completes at ``TELEMETRY_COLLECTING`` instead of continuing, and that has
  to be decided before the flow table is consulted, not after.
* ``BUG_FOUND`` hands the developer the bug context. Losing it turns a targeted fix into a guess.
